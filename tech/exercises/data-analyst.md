## Background Information

- There are 2 major products in Linkby, the Core product and the Pubfeed product
- All the timestamps in the dataset are stored in UTC timezone
  - When generating a report, we use the Sydney timezone by default (AEST/GMT+10)

  - 1 USD = 1.34 AUD
  - 1 GBP = 1.86 AUD
  - 1 SGD = 1.08 AUD
  - 1 CAD = 1.12 AUD

## Exercises

You are tasked with a total of **9** exercises.

We recommend **reading through all exercises before you begin your first one** so you can pace yourself within the allocated timeframe.

---

### Exercise 1

Get the campaign acceptance rate for all publisher accounts. The acceptance rate can be calculated by `(the number of campaigns accepted by a publisher / the number of campaigns pitched (invited) to a publisher)`.


### Exercise 2

Get the potential revenue for each publisher brand in Dec 2022.

Potential revenue means the total budget of all the campaigns pitched to a publisher brand.

Note: We use the Sydney timezone (AEST / GMT+10) to generate the report.


### Exercise 3

The programmatic click rate of campaign xxxx.

Programmatic clicks can be determined by repetitive signatures, such as the timestamp, user-agent and IP address.

### Exercise 4

The total revenue generated by advertisers from AU in Dec 2022.


### Exercise 5

The total revenue generated by the publisher accounts from AU in Dec 2022.


### Exercise 6

There was a discussion in the team about the performance of US publishers.

The management team assigned you to study it. You are asked to create a chart to show the funnel of conversion rates of all US Publishers to explain the situation.

Please create a chart for the funnel that can measure the publishersâ€™ performance. You should include a brief description to explain each conversion rate and why you consider these conversion rates necessary.


### Exercise 7

Calculate all UK publisher accounts' average Pubfeed product click-through rate. Click-through rate can be calculated by `(total clicks / total impression)`.

### Exercise 8

Calculate the average RPMs of all UK publishers. RPMs mean revenue-per-impressions. It can be calculated by `(total revenue / total impressions ) * 1000`.
